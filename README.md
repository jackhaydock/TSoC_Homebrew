# TSoC_Homebrew
Homebrew collection for 5e.tools for my 5e campaign setting, The Sea of Cyranos.

## How to Import

1. Goto
https://5e.tools/managebrew.html

3. Click "Load from URL"
4. Copy/Paste this url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackhaydock/TSoC_Homebrew/master/TSoC.json
5. Done

You should then be able to see "The Sea of Cyranos" in source filters and see things with the gold "TSoC" label.

*NOTE: you will need to repeat this everytime I update this, which I do frequently. I recomend deleting the old version before importing again as sometimes it bugs out and you'll get duplicate items*
